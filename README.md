Browser extension to take semantic, scalable, accessible screenshots of websites, as SVG - as simple as taking a PNG screenshot.

## Why use this?

SVG screenshots offer various benefits over normal PNG screenshots, while keeping the good parts:

- **🖼 Flexible**: Freely select the region of the website you want to capture.
- **💢 Scalable graphics**: Screenshots never get pixelated when zooming in.
- **📝 Semantic**: Text can still be selected and copied to clipboard.
- **🦻 Accessible**: SVG is annotated with ARIA attributes and can be read by screen readers.
- **🖥 Paste into design tools**: SVGs will work in design tools like Illustrator, Figma, Sketch etc.
- **🔗 Interactive**: Links are still clickable.
- **📦 Self-contained**: Inlines external resources like images, fonts, etc.
- **📸 Static**: Styles and layout are recorded at the time of snapshot and will not change when viewed on different machines.
