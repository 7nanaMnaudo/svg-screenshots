# How to Install IOS236 on Your Wii or Wii U
 
IOS236 is a patched version of IOS36 that makes installation of other IOSes easy, even if the other IOS slots are filled by stubs already. IOS236 can also access the Wii's NAND, which is useful for many homebrew applications. This guide will show you how to install IOS236 on your Wii or Wii U using the IOS236 Installer v6.zip file.

## What You Need
 
- A Wii or Wii U console with system menu 3.0 or higher (not compatible with Wii Mini)
- An SD card (2GB or less for system menu below 4.0, 4GB or more for system menu 4.0 or higher)
- A Wii remote (not a Motion Plus one if you are on system menu 3.0 or 3.1)
- The IOS236 Installer v6.zip file (download link: [https://gbatemp.net/download/ios236-installer.32100/](https://gbatemp.net/download/ios236-installer.32100/))

## Step 1: Prepare Your SD Card
 
Format your SD card to FAT32 using your computer. Then, extract the contents of the IOS236 Installer v6.zip file to the root of your SD card. You should have a folder named "apps" and a file named "IOS36-64-v3351.wad" on your SD card.
 
## Step 2: Install The Homebrew Channel
 
If you already have The Homebrew Channel (HBC) installed on your Wii or Wii U, you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow the instructions for your system menu version below to install HBC:

- For system menu 4.3, follow this guide: [https://wiidatabase.de/wii-u-vwii-downloads/hacks/ios236-installer/](https://wiidatabase.de/wii-u-vwii-downloads/hacks/ios236-installer/)
- For system menu 4.2, follow this guide: [https://mariokartwii.com/showthread.php?tid=34](https://mariokartwii.com/showthread.php?tid=34)
- For system menu 3.0 - 4.1, follow this guide: [https://mariokartwii.com/showthread.php?tid=34](https://mariokartwii.com/showthread.php?tid=34)

After installing HBC, do not exit the Hackmii Installer yet. We will need to also install BootMii in the next step.
 
## Step 3: Install BootMii
 
BootMii is a form of brick prevention that allows you to backup and restore your Wii's NAND. To install BootMii, follow these steps:

1. Navigate back to the Main Menu of the Hackmii Installer (where the options 'Install Homebrew Channel' and 'Install Bootmii' are listed).
2. Select 'Bootmii...'
3. Select 'Install Bootmii as boot2' if possible. If not, then select 'Install Bootmii as an IOS'.
4. Click Yes, Continue.
5. Bootmii will mount the SD card and write some files.
6. When done, return to the Main Menu and exit the Hackmii Installer.

## Step 4: Run IOS236 Installer
 
Now that you have HBC and BootMii installed, you can run the IOS236 Installer from HBC. Follow these steps:

1. Insert your SD card into your Wii or Wii U.
2. Turn on your console and launch HBC from the system menu.
3. Select IOS236 Installer from the list of applications and press A to load it.
4. Press 1 to start the installation process.
5. Select "Load IOS from SD card". 0f148eb4a0
